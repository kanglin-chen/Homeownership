## Abstract
Homeownership has long been an important component of housing policy initiatives. U.S. national homeownership has remained stagnant at around 65%, from the establishment of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1965 through the 2020s, prompting discussion about the effectiveness of related policies. Given the limited understanding of long-term housing trajectories, this study examines the trends and geographies of owner-occupied housing units (OOHU), homeownership rate (the percentage of owner-occupied units among all occupied units), population, and households from 1970 to 2020. Nationally, both the number of OOHU (from 39.8 million to 80.1 million) and households roughly doubled, while homeownership remained stable (63.0% in 1970 to 63.1% in 2020). This contrast suggests that even sizable expansions in the housing stock do not translate into higher homeownership, whereas declines are likely when housing growth lags behind increases in the number of households. The numbers of OOHUs, households, and population are closely related, though population grew more slowly than OOHUs, by about 1.6 times compared to 2 times. Disparities in the number of OOHU have widened despite relatively stable rates, with reduced spatial clustering and declining homeownership observed particularly in regions experiencing high housing and population growth. Overall, HUD has facilitated housing construction that keeps pace with household growth and accommodates smaller household sizes, though not enough to raise homeownership rate. This study highlights when and where housing divergences have emerged and underscores the need to better align housing supply, affordability, and planning intervention to promote more balanced regional development.
