## Abstract
The focus on homeownership and the effectiveness of policies by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development have been long-standing subjects of discussion. Given that the national homeownership rate has remained stagnant at around 65% for decades, and considering the limited understanding of its historical trajectory, this study examines the number of owner-occupied housing units and the homeownership rate (the percentage of owner-occupied units among all occupied housing units) from 1970 to 2020 using multiple statistical and spatial analyses. Nationally, the homeownership rate fluctuated but held steady, changing only slightly from 63.0% in 1970 to 63.1% in 2020, despite a doubling in the number of owner-occupied units from 39.8 million to 80.1 million. This suggests that increased housing stock does not necessarily lead to higher homeownership rates. The study also highlights growing geographic disparities in both housing stock and homeownership rates. County-level data show that the distribution of housing stock is increasingly right-skewed, with some counties having very high housing stock, while others appear as outliers with low homeownership. County median values, however, remain relatively stable. Meanwhile, the West and East Coasts have substantial growth in housing stock but show relatively low homeownership rates. It is possible that more populous and urban areas are seeing increases in both housing units and households while homeownership rates decline, whereas less populous areas have higher homeownership rates. This study identifies where and when these divergences occur and discusses potential contributing factors, drawing on previous research into local economic opportunities and demographic shifts.
