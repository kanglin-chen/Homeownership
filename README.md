## Abstract
US homeownership rates have hovered around 65% for decades, raising questions about the effectiveness of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This study examines homeownership trends from 1970 to 2020, focusing on the number of owner-occupied housing units and the homeownership rate (the percentage of these units among all occupied housing units). While the number of owner-occupied units doubled from 39.8 million to 80.1 million, the homeownership rate fluctuated but remained largely stable, shifting from 58.0% to 63.1%. A slight negative correlation between the homeownership rate and the number of units suggests that increased housing availability does not drive higher homeownership rates. Notably, regions such as the West and East Coasts, which saw significant increases in housing stock, maintained relatively low homeownership rates, with some experiencing declines in the rates. This study highlights a growing divergence in homeownership outcomes and the potential influence of local demographics and housing policies.
